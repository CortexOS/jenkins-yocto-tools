jenkins-yocto-tools
-------------------
Helper scripts for invoking bitbake in a jenkins job.  Handles
collecting artifacts, logging output, and provides forensics to help
debug build failures.

These scripts do not require you to delete the workspace between every
run.  Indeed, Jenkins does not do this unless you specifically configure
it to.  Build times are typically much faster in a previously-used
directory, since fewer parse, sstate, and build tasks will need to be
run.  The scripts use a lockfile to prevent multiple instances from
running in the same workspace, as well as to prevent any cleanup task
from removing an in-use workspace.  If a build fails, the workspace is
marked as having failed and tmp/ is removed on the next run.

In the case of a build failure, fail.tgz is created.  This tarball will
contain the work directory of the recipe that failed.
